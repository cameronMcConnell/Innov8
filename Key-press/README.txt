Changes images on window based on key presses

The program will open a window and intitialize a surface. This
surface can change based on a key press of left, right, up, or down. 
These images will be loaded to a specific member of a surface array 
with key press total size (5). The key press will correspond to a 
specific enum which is good practice for game development. KEY_PRESS_SURFACE_TOTAL 
is 5.
