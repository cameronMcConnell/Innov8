Draws different geometry using a renderer

This program takes a render object, intitializes a window
and the object itself, and draws geometry on the window. This
is done using different functions that let you set the draw color
of the renderer, how big the shapes should be and where they should be
started to be drawn from. Rather than the y-axis increasing while going up,
the y-axis increases while going down in SDL.
